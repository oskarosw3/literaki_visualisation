# Literaki visualisation

Project that takes a file in the format given by literaki (polish scrabble) in kurnik.pl and displays the final state of the board.


to do:

    turn by turn visualisation
    scraping directly from web (not having to have a file on the hardrive)
    add tiles in hand (both at the end and during the turn by turn)
    better graphics (more like the one in kurnik.pl)
